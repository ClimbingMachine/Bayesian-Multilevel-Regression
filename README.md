# Bayesian-Multilevel-Regression
The study developed a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression (BMLR) model to capture heterogeneity in behavioral studies. The proposed method incorporates group-specific effects that vary randomly between group based on a weakly informative prior. The first paper adopting this method in our study is under reviewing in Transportation Research Part F.

The code is written in R with the interface with Stan.
